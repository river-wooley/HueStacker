## Hue Stacker
Hue Stacker is a small game developed in GameMaker Studio and, of course, scripted in GML. It was designed for IMS 225 Games and Learning at Miami University, specifically with the intention of teaching color recognition in similar hues along a color gradient. The game teaches by distributed cognition, the psychological theory that states that cognition exists outside of an individual and specifically in the interaction between the individual and a system.

The game is played by selecting one of two difficulties, and then matching hues on the board by selecting a direction to move the cards.
